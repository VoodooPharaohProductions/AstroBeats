### Search

I want Astro Beats to search for Timebomb by Motionless in White, to do that I first need to join a voice channel, then I type `.absearch Timebomb`

Astro Beats will then provide me with a list of songs named Timebomb. I can change pages by reacting with the proper buttons provided but the song I'm looking for is second on the list 

> **`2.` [Motionless In White - Timebomb [OFFICIAL VISUALIZER VIDEO\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Ln8Suk0p4)** 

so I'm going to scroll down where I see Astro Beats has responded saying to `type the number of the song you want to play! Expires in 30 seconds` so I'm going to type `2` and Astro Beats will start playing my search
