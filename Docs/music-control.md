### Bass Boost

Astro Beats has the ability to turn the bass up on anything playing in the server queue. Users have the option to set the bass boost to 4 different levels:

| `none`| `low` | `medium` | `high` |

### Seek

I missed my favorite break down in the song I'm listening to and want to rewind the song to relisten to it, I can do this by, typing. `.abseek 2m 45s` and Astro Beats will skip back to that specific time in the song so I can listen to what I missed.
